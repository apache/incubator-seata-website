| server.max.commit.retry.timeout | Timeout duration of two-phase commit retry | Unit: ms, s, m, h, d, corresponding to ms, s, min, h, d, and the default is ms. The default value of - 1 means unlimited retries. Formula: timeout>=now globalTransactionBeginTime, true means no retry if timeout occurs|

### synchronize parameters to the configuration center for use demo

#### Nacos
shell:
```bash
sh ${SEATAPATH}/script/config-center/nacos/nacos-config.sh -h localhost -p 8848 -g SEATA_GROUP -t 5a3c7d6c-f497-4d68-a71a-2e5e3340b3ca
```

Parameter description:

-h: Host, the default is localhost

-p: Port, default 8848

-g: Configure grouping. The default value is' SEATA_ GROUP'

-t: Tenant information, corresponding to the namespace ID field of Nacos, the default value is null ''

#### Apollo
```bash
sh ${SEATAPATH}/script/config-center/apollo/apollo-config.sh -h localhost -p 8070 -e DEV -a seata-server -c default -n application -d apollo -r apollo -t 3aa026fc8435d0fc4505b345b8fa4578fb646a2c
```
Parameter description:

-h: Host, the default is localhost

-p: Port, the default value is 8070

-e: Managed configuration environment, default value DEV

-a: AppId of the Namespace. The default value is seata server

-c: The name of the managed configuration cluster is generally passed in as default. If it is a special cluster, just pass in the name of the corresponding cluster. The default value is default

-n: The name of the namespace under management, if it is not in the properties format, needs to add a suffix, such as sample Yml, default value application

-d: The creator of the item, in the format of domain account, that is, the user ID of the sso system

-r: Publisher, domain account, note: if Apollo ConfigDB namespace.lock in ServerConfig If the switch is set to true (false by default), the environment does not allow the publisher and editor to be the same person. So if the editor is zhangsan, the publisher can no longer be zhangsan.

-t: The Apollo administrator can click http://{portal_address}/open/manage Html To create a third-party application, you'd better first query whether this AppId has been created. After successful creation, a token will be generated

###Appendix 1:

Description of transaction grouping.

1. What is a transaction group?

Transaction grouping is the resource logic of seata, similar to service instance. My in file.conf_ test_ tx_ A group is a transaction group.

2. How to find the back-end cluster through transaction grouping?

First, the program configures transaction grouping (txServiceGroup parameter of GlobalTransactionScanner construction method), and the program will search for service.vgroup through the user configured configuration center_ mapping. Transaction grouping configuration item. The value of the configuration item obtained is the name of the TC cluster. The program that obtains the cluster name constructs the service name through a certain prefix+cluster name. The service name of each configuration center is different. Get the service name, go to the corresponding registry, pull the service list of the corresponding service name, and get the real TC service list of the back-end.

3. Why is the design so that the service name is not directly taken?

There is an additional layer to obtain the configuration of transaction groups to the mapping cluster. After this design, the transaction group can be used as the logical isolation unit of resources, which can quickly fail over when a failure occurs.



###Appendix 2:

About the grouplist question.

1. When will the default.grouplist in file.conf be used?

It is used when registry. type=file. It is not read in other times.

2. Can multiple value lists be configured for default.grouplist?

Multiple can be configured, which means cluster, but when store When mode=file, an error will be reported. The reason is that the file storage mode does not provide synchronization of local files, so you need to use store. mode=db to share data between TC clusters through db

3. Is default.grouplist recommended?

Not recommended. For example, question 1, when registering It is used when type=file, which means that the real registry is not used here, and the health check mechanism without specific services cannot automatically remove the list when the tc is unavailable. It is recommended to use nacos, eureka, redis, zk, consumer, etcd3, and sofa. Registry. type=file or config The original purpose of type=file design is to enable users to quickly verify the seata service through direct connection without relying on a third-party registry or configuration center.



###Appendix 3:

log_ Status=1 is defensive. It means that a global rollback request is received, but it is uncertain whether the local transaction of a transaction branch has been executed. At this time, a piece of data with the same branch ID is inserted in advance, and the inserted false data is successful. If the local transaction continues to execute, the master key conflict will be automatically rolled back.

If the insertion is unsuccessful, it indicates that the local transaction has been completed, and the undo data is taken out for reverse rollback.



###Appendix 4:

Whether to enable spring boot automatic assembly. If it is enabled, the integration of seata and spring boot will be automatically configured, including the automatic proxy of data source and initialization of GlobalTransactionScanner.

Note: New features of version 1.0 need to rely on seata spring boot starter.
