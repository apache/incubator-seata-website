# Release Guide

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Apache Version Release Documentation

Refer to the following link to understand the ASF release process:

- [Apache Release Guide](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-publishing)
- [Apache Release Policy](http://www.apache.org/dev/release.html)
- [Maven Release Info](http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html)

#### 1.2 PGP Signature

Follow the Apache release guidelines to sign the release version, allowing users to verify whether the downloaded version has been tampered with.

Create a `pgp` key for version signing, using **\<your Apache ID>@apache.org** as the key USER-ID.

For more details, refer to the [Apache Releases Signing documentation](https://infra.apache.org/release-signing) and [Cryptography with OpenPGP](http://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html).

Here is a brief process for generating the key:http://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html)

Here is a brief process for generating the key:

- Generate a new `gpg` key using `gpg --full-gen-key`, setting the key length to 4096.

  Note: You can set the key to never expire or choose a specific expiration time based on your needs. However, you will need to update the public key after it expires in the [DEV KEYS file](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/seata/KEYS) and the [RELEASE KEYS file](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/seata/KEYS).

- Upload the key to a public key server using `gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --send-key <your key id>`.

  Note: If the access fails, you can upload the public key online via the [OpenPGP Keyserver (ubuntu.com)](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/).

```
You can find the key ID using the command: gpg --list-signatures --keyid-format LONG
pub   rsa4096/XXXX 2024-09-19 [SC] [expires: 2027-09-19]
      F2D3A28A392129B927C7FB42XXXX
uid                   [ultimate] XXXX <XXXX@apache.org>
sig 3        XXXX 2024-09-19  [self-signed]
sub   rsa4096/XXXXXXX 2024-09-19 [E] [expires: 2027-09-19]
sig          XXXX 2024-09-19  [self-signed]
The key ID is XXXX.
```

- Export the public key to a text file using the command: `gpg --armor --output ./public-key.txt --export XXXX`.
- Append the generated key to the [DEV KEYS file](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/seata/KEYS) and the [RELEASE KEYS file](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/seata/KEYS).
Note:

The DEV SVN repository can be added by the Release Manager, while the RELEASE SVN repository requires PMC permissions and can be assisted by the PMC to upload the KEY.

**Tips:** You need to set the default public key. If you have multiple public keys, please modify `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`.

Reference example:

```

"Username (comment) <email address>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O

You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key. (Set password)

```

Convert the generated public key and private key to ASCII format:

```
gpg --armor --output ./public-key.txt --export XXXX
gpg --armor --output ./private-key.txt --export-secret-keys XXXX

```

View the key list:

```
[root@localhost ~]# gpg --list-signatures --keyid-format LONG
[keyboxd]
---------
pub   rsa4096/XXXX 2024-09-19 [SC] [有效至：2027-09-19]
      F2D3A28A392129B927C7FB42XXXX

sig          XXXX 2024-09-19  [自签名]

```

Upload the public key to the key server

```
[root@localhost gpgtest]# gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --send-key XXXX
gpg: sending key XXXX to hkp server keys.openpgp.org

```

#### 1.3 POM Configuration

Configure the POM file to deploy the version to the ASF Nexus repository.

① Add Apache POM inheritance for default settings.

```
<parent>
    <groupId>org.apache</groupId>
    <artifactId>apache</artifactId>
    <version>XX</version>
</parent>

```

② Add key information to the Maven configuration file `settings.xml`.

```
<settings>
    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>signed_release</id>
            <properties>
                <mavenExecutorId>forked-path</mavenExecutorId>
                <gpg.keyname>yourKeyName</gpg.keyname>
          <deploy.url>https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/seata/</deploy.url>
            </properties>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
    <servers>
        <!-- To publish a snapshot of some part of Maven -->
        <server>
            <id>apache.snapshots.https</id>
            <username>yourApacheID</username>
            <!-- Use the password encryption by maven -->
            <password>yourApachePassword</password>
        </server>
        <!-- To stage a release of some part of Maven -->
        <server>
            <id>apache.releases.https</id>
            <username>yourApacheID</username>
            <password>yourApachePassword</password>
        </server>
        <server>
            <id>gpg.passphrase</id>
            <passphrase>yourKeyPassword</passphrase>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>

```

**Tips:** It is recommended to use [Maven's password encryption capabilities](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html) to encrypt `gpg.passphrase`.

#### 1.5 Release Notes

Build the corresponding version's Release Notes from the [changelog](https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/blob/2.x/changes/zh-cn/2.x.md).

## 2. Release Process

### 1. Prepare Branch

Create a new branch from the main branch as the release branch. For example, if you are going to release version `${release_version}`, create a new branch `${release_version}` from the development branch. All modifications and tagging related to `${release_version}` Release Candidates will be done in the `${release_version}` branch, ensuring that all GitHub Actions CI checks pass. After the release is completed, merge this branch back into the main branch.

Example: If the Java SDK needs to release version `2.2.0`, create a new branch `2.2.0` from the `2.x` branch, and commit changes in this branch to replace the Snapshot version number with `2.2.0`.

### 2. Pre-release Binary Package

#### 2.1 SDK Preparation for Release

Prepare the release according to the instructions in [publishing maven artifacts](https://infra.apache.org/publishing-maven-artifacts.html) [4].

```
mvn clean deploy -Prelease -DskipTests -e -B -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.org.apache.maven.cli.transfer.Slf4jMavenTransferListener=warn
```

At this point, the Seata SDK is published to the [staging repository](https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories) (you need to log in with your Apache account credentials). Find the released version, `${STAGING.RELEASE}`, and click Close.

Note: If closing fails, it may be because the public key corresponding to the signing key cannot be retrieved from [keys.openpgp.org](http://keys.openpgp.org/). Please check yourself using the [OpenPGP Keyserver (ubuntu.com)](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/).

#### 2.2 Submit Source & Binary to SVN Repository

##### 2.2.1 Install SVN

Download and install from [Download Apache Subversion Sources](https://subversion.apache.org/download.cgi#recommended-release)

Alternatively, you can quickly install it using `brew install subversion`.

##### 2.2.2 Compile seata-server and seata-namingserver

Run the following command:

```
mvn -Prelease-seata -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dskip.npm=true -T4C -Dpmd.skip=true clean install -U
```

##### 2.2.3 Sign the Source and Binary

For the Source, it is recommended to download the zip package directly from the corresponding version branch on GitHub, such as 2.2.0, to avoid polluting the Source package content in your local environment. Then rename it to `apache-seata-x.x.x-incubating-src.zip`.

Run the following command to generate a SHA-512 checksum:

```
shasum -b -a 512 apache-seata-x.x.x-incubating-src.zip >> apache-seata-x.x.x-incubating-src.zip.sha512
```

Sign the Binary:

```
gpg --armor --output apache-seata-x.x.x-incubating-bin.zip.asc apache-seata-x.x.x-incubating-bin.zip
```

For the Binary, generate a SHA-512 checksum:

```
shasum -b -a 512 apache-seata-x.x.x-incubating-bin.tar.gz >> apache-seata-x.x.x-incubating-bin.tar.gz.sha512
```

Sign the Binary:

```
gpg --armor --output apache-seata-x.x.x-incubating-bin.tar.gz.asc apache-seata-x.x.x-incubating-bin.tar.gz
```

Verify the SHA-512 checksum:

```
shasum -c apache-seata-x.x.x-incubating-bin.tar.gz.sha512
```

Verify the signature:

```
gpg --verify apache-seata-x.x.x-incubating-src.zip.asc apache-seata-x.x.x-incubating-src.zip
```

##### 2.2.4 Check Out SVN Locally, Create Release Version Path, and Move Signature Files, Source, and Binary into It

Check out the SVN directory:

```
svn co --depth=empty https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/seata/
```

Create the release version path and move the files into it:

```
cd seata
mkdir incubator-seata/x.x.x-RCn/
mv ../x.x.x incubator-seata/x.x.x-RCn/
```

After executing the above commands, the structure should look approximately like this:

```
-rw-r--r--@ 1 fe-work  staff   180M  9 20 10:16 apache-seata-2.2.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--@ 1 fe-work  staff   180M  9 20 10:16 apache-seata-2.2.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz.asc
-rw-r--r--@ 1 fe-work  staff   187B  9 20 10:16 apache-seata-2.2.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz.sha512
-rw-r--r--@ 1 fe-work  staff   6.7M  9 20 10:16 apache-seata-2.2.0-incubating-src.zip
-rw-r--r--@ 1 fe-work  staff   6.7M  9 20 10:16 apache-seata-2.2.0-incubating-src.zip.asc
-rw-r--r--  1 fe-work  staff   300B  9 20 10:16 apache-seata-2.2.0-incubating-src.zip.sha512
```

The KEYS file in the parent `seata` directory needs to ensure that the public key generated in the first step is appended.

Run the following commands:

```
svn add x.x.x
svn commit -m "submit x.x.x version"
```

If you updated the KEYS file, you need to run `svn update KEYS` before committing.

After executing the commit, you will be prompted to enter your Apache LDAP username and password. Enter them to successfully submit the changes.

```
➜  seata svn commit -m 'submit 2.2.0 version'

```

#### 2.3 Creating Tag and Release Note

##### 2.3.1 Creating a Tag

Execute the following command in the x.x.x branch:

```
Copy Codegit tag vx.x.x -m 'release: release for x.x.x'
```

Then push the tag to the upstream (seata repository):

```
Copy Codegit push upstream vx.x.x
```

##### 2.3.2 Creating a Release Note

Create a release note using the following link: [New release · apache/incubator-seata (github.com)](https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/releases/new) and set "Choose a tag" to the corresponding tag.

Set it as "Set as a pre-release." After the overall vote passes, change it to "Set as the latest release."
