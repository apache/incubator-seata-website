   <summary><mark>Notes</mark></summary>
   If you upgrade from 1.8.x to 2.0.x, if you configure the Undolog or communication codec to FST, you need to change the serialization mode to something other than FST on the client before you can upgrade it on the server.
   Note: In version 2.0.0 of the server, there is a resource reentry issue in AT mode. For example, in a global transaction, if multiple local transactions make repeated data modifications that are not the same, registering multiple branches can lead to abnormal ordering of the two-phase commit. Therefore, if you encounter such scenarios, please refrain from upgrading to version 2.0.0 and consider upgrading to the latest snapshot or a higher version.

   When upgrading from version 1.5.x to version 1.6.x, both client SDK and seata-server are completely smoothly compatible, and no other changes are required other than upgrading the version.

1. When the storage mode of seata-server is db, you need to pay attention to the table structure changes. You need to change the table structure before upgrading to 1.5.0:

  - The table structure character set is uniformly adjusted from utf8 to utf8mb4.
  - The `global_table` adjustment index is adjusted from `idx_gmt_modified_status` to `idx_status_gmt_modified`.
  - `lock_table` adds `status` field, and adds `idx_status`, `idx_xid_and_branch_id` index.
  - Add `distributed_lock` table for seata-server asynchronous task scheduling.
   Before upgrading to 1.5.0, please pay attention to the table structure changes. For details on the table structure, please [click here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/tree/1.5.0/script/server/db).
   
2. TCC transaction mode adds anti-hanging function in 1.5.0. If you need to enable anti-hanging by Seata framework, you need to add [this table](https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/tree/1.5.0/script/client/tcc/db) to the client business library in advance. 
   
3. The first-stage method of TCC mode has been optimized. It is no longer necessary to define `BusinessActionContext` as an interface parameter in the first stage. If `BusinessActionContext` needs to be used in the first stage, it can be obtained through `BusinessActionContextUtil.getContext()`.

4. The internal structure of the redis registration center has been adjusted and is no longer backward compatible. If you use redis as the registration center of seata, please also upgrade both seata-all (seata-spring-boot-starter) and seata-server that the client depends on.

5. The transaction group configuration supports default values. In order to avoid ambiguity and reduce learning costs, the default transaction group is changed from `my_test_tx_group` to `default_tx_group`. It will be backward compatible in version 1.5.X.

1. The Redis data of version 1.3 and 1.4 are incompatible. Since the Redis mode reconstructs the data storage structure into hash, users who upgrade from 1.3 to 1.4 need to wait for all transactions to run completely before iterating.

<h3 id='4'>4. What compatibility matters need to be paid attention to when upgrading to seata 1.3.0? </h3>
<details>
   <summary><mark>Notes</mark></summary>

1. The nacos registration center adds a new group attribute configuration `seata.registry.nacos.group`. If it is not configured, the default value is `DEFAULT_GROUP`. The server and client must be consistent.
2. The mysql `undolog` table removes the `id` field and enhances the timestamp accuracy together with `branch_table` to prevent dirty data from being rolled back due to sequence errors during undolog rollback. (Note: mysql version 5.6 or above is required)

1. The nacos registration center adds a new service attribute configuration `registry.nacos.application` = "seata-server". The original default name is serverAddr, and now the default is seata-server. The Server and Client must be consistent.

1. Pay attention to the compatibility of configuration items. Version 1.1.0 has unified the styles of configuration items.
If the program relies on seata-all, corresponding to the *.conf file, the naming style of the configuration items in the conf file is unified with a dot + camel case combination, [1.1.0 Configuration Item Description](/docs/user/configurations), [1.1.0 Configuration Reference](https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/tree/1.1.0/script/client/conf);
If the program depends on seata-spring-boot-starter, corresponding to *.properties or *.yml, the naming style of property and yml files is unified to the combination of dot + underscore.
[1.1.0 Configuration Reference](https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/tree/1.1.0/script/client/spring) What needs special attention is the 1.0.0 version configuration item seata.service
.vgroup-mapping=default 1.1.0 changed to: seata.service.vgroup-mapping
.my_test_tx_group=default, where my_test_tx_group represents the transaction group used by the program; 1.0.0 version configuration item seata.service.grouplist=127.0.0.1:8091, 1.1.0
Change to: seata.service.grouplist.default=127.0.0.1:8091 where default represents the seata registration service name.

2. seata-all does not enable automatic proxying of data sources by default. The original conf file configuration items in seata-all
The client.support.spring.datasource.autoproxy configuration item is invalid and is annotated by @EnableAutoDataSourceProxy
Instead of annotation, the annotation parameter can choose to use jdk proxy or cglib proxy. When using HikariDataSource, it is recommended to use cglib proxy mode.
seata-spring-boot-starter enables the data source proxy by default, and the corresponding data source automatic proxy configuration items remain unchanged from version 1.0.0.

3. When using the spring cloud framework, you need to use [Spring Cloud Alibaba](https://github.com/alibaba/spring-cloud-alibaba) for seata
Transmission of transaction context. So seata has integration dependencies with Spring Cloud Alibaba version, refer to [version notes](https://github.com/alibaba/spring-cloud-alibaba/wiki/%E7%89%88%E6%9C%AC%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E)
spring-cloud-alibaba-seata relied on seata-all before version 2.2.0.RELEASE. If you continue to use a lower version of spring-cloud-alibaba-seata, you can use a higher version of seata-all to replace the built-in seata-all version;
Spring-cloud-alibaba-seata starts to rely on seata-spring-boot-starter internally starting from 2.2.0.RELEASE (inclusive). 2.2.0.RELEASE internally integrates seata-spring-boot-starter 1.0.0 and can be upgraded to seata-spring-boot-starter 1.1.0, seata-spring-boot-starter integrates seata-all, seata-spring-boot-starter wraps the autoconfig function for properties or yml configuration, in spring-cloud-alibaba-seata Before 2.2.0.RELEASE
The autoconfig function is supported by itself. Afterwards, the autoconfig about seata itself in spring-cloud-alibaba-seata is removed and is supported by seata-spring-boot-starter. Therefore, the lower version of spring-cloud-alibaba-seata can only be used with seata-all. Use, the higher version spring-cloud-alibaba-seata can only be used with seata-spring-boot-starter, with 2.2.0.RELEASE as the dividing point.

4. When the TC side adopts db storage mode, the precision of gmt_create and gmt_modified fields is added to branch_table to accurately confirm the order of rollback.
