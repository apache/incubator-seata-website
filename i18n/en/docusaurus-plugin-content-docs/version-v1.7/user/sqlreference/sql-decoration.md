# SQL Decoration

Seata's isolation level defaults to read uncommitted. In this mode, the SQL decoration usage of select statements in this article table is supported. Using for update proxy can make Seata achieve read committed. In this mode, the usage of select statements can only be partially supported.

### DML Statement Support

| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| AND & OR     | `UPDATE â€¦ WHERE col_name1=expr1 AND col_name2= expr2`        | Yes       |
| LIKE         | `UPDATE ... WHERE col_name1 LIKE 'NE'`                       | Yes       |
