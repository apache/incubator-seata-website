# Deploy Seata Server By Docker Compose

## Version Deployment History 

[Version before 1.5.0](/docs/ops/deploy-by-docker-compose-142/)

[Version 1.5.0 and above](/docs/ops/deploy-by-docker-compose/)

## Precautions 
- Please avoid directly pulling the latest version image. The latest version is not necessarily a stable version. To avoid unnecessary problems, please go to [docker image warehouse](https://hub.docker.com/r/seataio/seata-server/tags) to determine the image version to be pulled.

## Quick Start

* <a href="#file-file">No Registration Center, File Storage</a>
* <a href="#file-db">No Registration Center, db Storage</a>
* <a href="#nacos-db">Nacos Registration Center, db Storage</a>
* <a href="#ha-nacos-db">High Available Usage Deployment</a>

### <a id="file-file">No Registration Center, File Storage</a>

In this mode, there is no need for a registration center or any third-party storage center.

docker-compose.yaml
```yaml
version: "3.1"
services:
  seata-server:
    image: seataio/seata-server:${latest-release-version}
    hostname: seata-server
    ports:
      - "8091:8091"
    environment:
      - SEATA_PORT=8091
      - STORE_MODE=file
```

### <a id="file-db">No Registration Center, db Storage</a>

> The db mode needs to create the corresponding table structure in the database, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/tree/develop/script/server/db">[table creation script]</a>.

**(1) Prepare configuration file: file.conf**

For more storage mode support, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/blob/develop/script/config-center/config.txt">More Storage Modes</a>.

```properties
# Storage mode
store.mode=db

store.db.datasource=druid
store.db.dbType=mysql
# Need to adjust driverClassName according to mysql version
# Driver corresponding to mysql8 and above versions is: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
# Driver for versions below mysql8 is: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
store.db.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
# Pay attention to adjusting the parameters host and port according to the actual production situation.
store.db.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/seata-server?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf8&connectTimeout=1000&socketTimeout=3000&autoReconnect=true&useSSL=false
# database username
store.db.user=
# Username Password
store.db.password=
```

**(2) Prepare file: registry.conf**

For more registration center support, please refer to <a href="/docs/user/registry/">Registration Center</a>

For more configuration center support, please refer to <a href="/docs/user/configuration/">Configuration Center</a>

}
```

**(3) Prepare file: docker-compose.yaml**

       - "./seata-server/config:/root/seata-config"
```

### <a id="ha-nacos-db">High Available Usage Deployment</a>

> Seata high availability usage deployment relies on the registration center and database, but does not depend on the configuration center.

## Environment variables

seata-server supports the following environment variables:

- **SEATA_IP**

> Optional. It specifies the IP started by seata-server. This IP is used when registering with the registration center, such as eureka, etc.

- **SEATA_PORT**

> Optional. It is used to specify the port where seata-server starts. The default port is `8091`.

- **STORE_MODE**

> Optional. It is used to specify the transaction log storage method of seata-server, supports `db`, `file`, `redis` (supported by Seata-Server 1.3 and above). The default value is `file`.

- **SERVER_NODE**

> Optional. It is used to specify the seata-server node ID, such as `1`,`2`,`3`... The default value is `generated based on ip`.

- **SEATA_ENV**

> Optional. It is used to specify the seata-server operating environment, such as `dev`, `test`, etc. When the service is started, configurations such as `registry-dev.conf` will be used.

- **SEATA_CONFIG_NAME**

> Optional. It is used to specify the configuration file location, such as `file:/root/registry`, which will load `/root/registry.conf` as the configuration file. If you need to specify the `file.conf` file at the same time, you need to change the value of `config.file.name` in `registry.conf` to something like `file:/root/file.conf`.
