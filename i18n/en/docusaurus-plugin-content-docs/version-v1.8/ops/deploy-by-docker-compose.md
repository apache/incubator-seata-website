# Deploy Seata Server By Docker Compose

## Precautions 
- Please avoid directly pulling the latest version image. The latest version is not necessarily a stable version. To avoid unnecessary problems, please go to [docker image warehouse](https://hub.docker.com/r/seataio/seata-server/tags) to determine the image version to be pulled.
- Starting from Seata Server version 1.5.0, the configuration file has been changed to application.yml. So when using custom configuration, you need to copy the native configuration first.

## Use custom configuration file
In order to obtain the configuration file of seata server 1.5.0, we need to first start a service of seata server 1.5.0, then copy the default configuration file from the started container instance, and then modify it.

docker-compose.yaml
```yaml
version: "3.1"
services:
  seata-server:
    image: seataio/seata-server:${latest-release-version}
    ports:
      - "7091:7091"
      - "8091:8091"
```

Next, copy the resource file in the `/seata-server/resources` location in the container to the specified location of the host through the `docker cp` command.
In the specified location of the host, we can see the corresponding `application.yml` configuration file, and the relevant configuration only needs to modify this file.

> The configuration of `application.yml` can refer to [application.example.yml](https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/blob/develop/server/src/main/resources/application.example.yml)

## Quick Start

* <a href="#file-file">No Registration Center, File Storage</a>
* <a href="#file-db">No Registration Center, db Storage</a>
* <a href="#nacos-db">Nacos Registration Center, db Storage</a>
* <a href="#ha-nacos-db">High Available Usage Deployment</a>

### <a id="file-file">No Registration Center, File Storage</a>

In this mode, there is no need for a registration center or any third-party storage center.

docker-compose.yaml
```yaml
version: "3.1"
services:
  seata-server:
    image: seataio/seata-server:${latest-release-version}
    hostname: seata-server
    ports:
      - "7091:7091"
      - "8091:8091"
    environment:
      - SEATA_PORT=8091
      - STORE_MODE=file
```

### <a id="file-db">No Registration Center, db Storage</a>

> The db mode needs to create the corresponding table structure in the database, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/tree/develop/script/server/db">[table creation script]</a>.

**（1）application.yml**

## Environment variables

seata-server supports the following environment variables:

- **SEATA_IP**

> Optional. It specifies the IP started by seata-server. This IP is used when registering with the registration center, such as eureka, etc.

- **SEATA_PORT**

> Optional. It is used to specify the port where seata-server starts. The default port is `8091`.

- **STORE_MODE**

> Optional. It is used to specify the transaction log storage method of seata-server, supports `db`, `file`, `redis` (supported by Seata-Server 1.3 and above). The default value is `file`.

- **SERVER_NODE**

> Optional. It is used to specify the seata-server node ID, such as `1`,`2`,`3`... The default value is `generated based on ip`.

- **SEATA_ENV**

> Optional. It is used to specify the seata-server operating environment, such as `dev`, `test`, etc. When the service is started, configurations such as `registry-dev.conf` will be used.

- **SEATA_CONFIG_NAME**

> Optional. It is used to specify the configuration file location, such as `file:/root/registry`, which will load `/root/registry.conf` as the configuration file. If you need to specify the `file.conf` file at the same time, you need to change the value of `config.file.name` in `registry.conf` to something like `file:/root/file.conf`.
