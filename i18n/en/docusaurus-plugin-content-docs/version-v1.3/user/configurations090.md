| metrics.registry-type | indicator registrar type | The indicator registrar type used by Metrics is a built-in compact (simple) implementation by default. Meters in this implementation only use limited memory counts, and the performance is high enough to meet most scenarios; Currently, only one indicator registrar can be set|

###Appendix 1:

Description of transaction grouping.

1. What is a transaction group?

Transaction grouping is the resource logic of seata, similar to service instance. My in file.conf_ test_ tx_ A group is a transaction group.

2. How to find the back-end cluster through transaction grouping?

First, the program configures transaction grouping (txServiceGroup parameter of GlobalTransactionScanner construction method), and the program will search for service.vgroup through the user configured configuration center_ mapping. Transaction grouping configuration item. The value of the configuration item obtained is the name of the TC cluster. The program that obtains the cluster name constructs the service name through a certain prefix+cluster name. The service name of each configuration center is different. Get the service name, go to the corresponding registry, pull the service list of the corresponding service name, and get the real TC service list of the back-end.

3. Why is the design so that the service name is not directly taken?

There is an additional layer to obtain the configuration of transaction groups to the mapping cluster. After this design, the transaction group can be used as the logical isolation unit of resources, which can quickly fail over when a failure occurs.



###Appendix 2:

About the grouplist question.

1. When will the default.grouplist in file.conf be used?

It is used when registry. type=file. It is not read in other times.

2. Can multiple value lists be configured for default.grouplist?

Multiple can be configured, which means cluster, but when store When mode=file, an error will be reported. The reason is that the file storage mode does not provide synchronization of local files, so you need to use store. mode=db to share data between TC clusters through db

3. Is default.grouplist recommended?

Not recommended. For example, question 1, when registering It is used when type=file, which means that the real registry is not used here, and the health check mechanism without specific services cannot automatically remove the list when the tc is unavailable. It is recommended to use nacos, eureka, redis, zk, consumer, etcd3, and sofa. Registry. type=file or config The original purpose of type=file design is to enable users to quickly verify the seata service through direct connection without relying on a third-party registry or configuration center.



###Appendix 3:

log_ Status=1 is defensive. It means that a global rollback request is received, but it is uncertain whether the local transaction of a transaction branch has been executed. At this time, a piece of data with the same branch ID is inserted in advance, and the inserted false data is successful. If the local transaction continues to execute, the master key conflict will be automatically rolled back.

If the insertion is unsuccessful, it indicates that the local transaction has been completed, and the undo data is taken out for reverse rollback.
