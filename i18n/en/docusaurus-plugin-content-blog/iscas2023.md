### Seata Open Source Summer 2023
Open Source Summer is a summer open source activity initiated and long-term supported by the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, as part of the "Open Source Software Supply Chain Lighting Program", aimed at encouraging students to actively participate in the development and maintenance of open source software, cultivating and discovering more outstanding developers, promoting the vigorous development of excellent open source software communities, and assisting in the construction of the open source software supply chain.

Participating students will collaborate remotely online with senior mentors to participate in the development of various organizational projects in the open source community and receive bonuses, gifts, and certificates. **These gains are not only a highlight on future graduation resumes but also a brilliant starting point towards becoming top developers.** Each project is divided into two difficulty levels: basic and advanced, with corresponding project completion bonuses of RMB 8,000 and RMB 12,000 before tax, respectively.

### Introduction to the Seata Community
**Seata** is an open-source distributed transaction solution, with over 23K+ stars on GitHub, dedicated to providing high-performance and easy-to-use distributed transaction services under the microservices architecture. Before being open-sourced, Seata played a role as a middleware for distributed data consistency within Alibaba, where almost every transaction needed to use Seata. After undergoing the baptism of Double 11's massive traffic, it provided strong technical support for business.

#### Project One: Implementation of NamingServer for Service Discovery and Registration

**Difficulty:** Advanced

**Project Community Mentor:** Chen Jianbin

**Mentor's Contact Email:** 364176773@qq.com

**Project Description:**  
Currently, Seata's service exposure and discovery mainly rely on third-party registration centers. With the evolution and development of the project, it brings additional learning and usage costs. Most mainstream middleware with servers have begun to evolve their own service self-loop and control and provide components or functions with higher compatibility and reliability to the server, such as Kafka's KRaft, RocketMQ's NameServer, ClickHouse's ClickHouse Keeper, etc. To address the above problems and architectural evolution requirements, Seata needs to build its own NamingServer to ensure more stability and reliability.
