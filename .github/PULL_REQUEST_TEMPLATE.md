Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:

- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata-website/issues) filed for the change(usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes such as typos do not necessitate a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should solely focus on addressing this specific issue without incorporating any other modifications. Each PR should resolve a single issue.
- [ ] Format the pull request title like `doc: add an operations guide document`. Each commit within the pull request should contain a meaningful subject line and body.
- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
- [ ] Test your code locally by running `npm run build`, and make sure it works as expected.
- [ ] Ensure that no files under the `build` folder are included in the commit, as well as the `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock` files.
