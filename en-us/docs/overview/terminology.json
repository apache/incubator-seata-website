It's similar to wget.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it also plays the role of peer, which can transfer data between each other in P2P network.</p>\n<h2>dfdaemon</h2>\n<p>Dfdaemon is used for pulling images only. It establishes a proxy between dockerd/pouchd and registry.</p>\n<p>Dfdaemon filters out layer fetching requests from all requests sent by dockerd/pouchd when pulling images, then uses dfget to downloading these layers.</p>\n",
