So, a more accurate description would be 4096/ms. The distinction between 4 million/s and 4096/ms lies in the fact that the former doesn't require every millisecond's concurrency to be below 4096.

The core idea of the improvement is to decouple from the operating system's timestamp, with the generator obtaining the system's current timestamp only during initialization as the initial timestamp. Subsequently, it no longer synchronizes with the system timestamp. The incrementation is solely driven by the incrementation of the sequence number. For example, when the sequence number reaches its maximum value (4095), the next request causes an overflow of the 12-bit space. The sequence number resets to zero, and the overflow carry is added to the timestamp, incrementing it by 1. Thus, the timestamp and sequence number can be considered as a single entity.
