The Seata framework perfectly solves these problems in version 1.5.1.\nThe operations on the tcc_fence_log table also need to consider transaction control. Seata uses a proxy data source to execute the operations on the tcc_fence_log table and the RM business operations in the same local transaction. This ensures that the local operations and the operations on the tcc_fence_log table succeed or fail together."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,c.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},24334:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/fence-empty-rollback-55e0c44f8e67d5df91c0f930860baa1f.png"},7101:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/fence-fiffrent-db-1f7a834639aa755d73fa2af435c4f042.png"},29220:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/fence-suspend-054f87611ab16153c07bd28495c6902c.png"},80288:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/fence-try-cancel-eafbbb62134fe4e3ed61bdc2a47461b9.png"},81665:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/fence-try-commit-453b9a1e280200057448436ecd7eef27.png"},28453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>o,x:()=>r});var a=n(96540);const c={},s=a.createContext(c);function o(e){const t=a.useContext(s);return a.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(c):e.components||c:o(e.components),a.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
