We had to decide at which layer to solve the data consistency problem. We compared the consistency requirements, universality, implementation complexity, and business integration costs faced when solving data consistency issues at different levels. In the end, we weighed the pros and cons, decided to keep the implementation complexity to ourselves, and adopted the AT mode initially as a consistency component.

This set of systematized open-source solutions is designed based on the best practices of Alibaba's e-commerce ecosystem. Second, standardization is another important feature. Taking OpenSergo as an example, it is both a standard and an implementation. In the past few years, the number of domestic open-source projects has exploded. However, the capabilities of various open-source products vary greatly, and many compatibility issues arise when integrating with each other.
